    <section id="about">
        <p>
            My name is Vipul Bansal. I am currently a junior 
            at Walton High School and founded this company 
            during my sophomore year at Walton. I always heard 
            people asking for help when deciding what smart devices 
            to buy, what security systems are the most effective, 
            and overall how to have a smarter and safer home. 
            I founded this company to help with just that, 
            making all the homes that I can smarter and safer.
        </p>

            I also realized that many traditional smart home 
            businesses charge hundreds of dollars per hour. I wanted to 
            make smart home and security devices as accessible as possible, 
            so I decided to charge only $50/hour and help my community get 
            the best deals on the devices they buy, taking advantage of 
            the best sales and deals that I can find.
